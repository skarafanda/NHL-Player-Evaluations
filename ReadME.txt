NHL Player/Team/League Evaluations using the NHL API and Python!

Examples of how to use the NHL Analysis Code: 

gamePlotShots: 

This code is useful for viewing the location of shots, number of shots, and score during an NHL game. This code is close to real-time, so if you wanted some quite visual shot analysis, running this code during the between or mid-period stoppages would be useful! As a general rule of thumb, shots closer to the net are higher quality, and shots closer to the center of this ice are more valuable than those near the boards due to more openings and higher chances of deflections.
